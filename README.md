# XML Output Documentation

This documentation explains the structure of the XML data generated by an ns-3–based simulation program implementing PSO-GA routing optimization in a UAV mobility scenario.

- Each node generates an output file with the following format:

```
node_<nodeId>_data.xml
```

- The basic structure of the XML file is as follows:

```
<Node id="1">
    <Record>...</Record>
    <Record>...</Record>
    ...
    
    <BestRouteResult round="1">...</BestRouteResult>
    <BestRouteResult round="2">...</BestRouteResult>
    ...
    
    <Summary>...</Summary>
</Node>
```

- The structure consists of three main sections:

| Element           | Function                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Record`          | Detailed log of each received packet          |
| `BestRouteResult` | PSO-GA optimization result per round          |
| `Summary`         | Node performance summary                      |

- Example for node ID in the ns-3 simulatio.

```
<Node id="1">
```

- This element is recorded each time the node receives a packet.

```
<Record>
    <Sender>99</Sender>
    <Receiver>1</Receiver>
    <Time_Seconds>3.000</Time_Seconds>
    <RSSI_dBm>-67.45</RSSI_dBm>
    <PerHop_Delay>0.000005</PerHop_Delay>
    <Propagation_Delay>0.000002</Propagation_Delay>
    <Transmission_Delay>0.000001</Transmission_Delay>
    <QueueProcessing_Delay>0.000002</QueueProcessing_Delay>
    <Flow_PDR_Percent>100.00</Flow_PDR_Percent>
    <Distance_Meters>125.50</Distance_Meters>
    <Sent_Packets>10</Sent_Packets>
    <Received_Packets>10</Received_Packets>
</Record>
```
